# MrQ Frontend Challenge - My Solution üöÄ

Hey! Thanks for checking out my solution to the MrQ frontend challenge. Here's what I managed to get done in the time frame and what I'd love to do if I had more time to play with it.

## What's Working? üëç

### Main Features

- Got those stock cards looking pretty sweet with all the animations (shake, glow, scaling)
- Made everything responsive - works on your phone and desktop
- Added that price chart that shows up when you click a card
- Fixed that tricky race condition in the price history chart
- Cards remember if they're selected even when you switch tabs

### Under the Hood Stuff

- Split up the code nicely to keep the initial load snappy
- Made sure things only re-render when they really need to (React.memo is my friend)
- Kept the CSS clean and organized with BEM
- Added some basic tests to make sure everything's working as it should

## What I'd Love to Add With More Time ‚è∞

Look, 2-4 hours flies by when you're having fun!

### More Testing

I got the basics covered, but would love to add:

- More thorough component testing
- Some proper integration tests
- Edge case testing (what happens when things go wrong?)
- Better mocking

### Performance Boosts

- Make it handle tons of stock cards smoothly
- More code splitting magic
- Make those animations butter-smooth on any device

### Extra Features

- Better error handling
- Make it more accessible
- Make it even better on mobile

## Some Quick Notes on Tech Choices ü§ì

- Used React.memo to keep those card updates snappy
- Went with CSS Modules to keep styles organized
- Added some basic tests to catch obvious issues
- Tried to keep the code clean and readable

## Thank You! üôè

I really appreciate the opportunity to work on this challenge! It was a fun project.

Even though there's always more that could be added (isn't there always? üòÖ), I tried to focus on delivering a solid core experience within the time constraint. I'd love to chat about any of my decisions or hear your thoughts on what I could do better.

Thanks again for checking out my solution!
